## WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion

[Understanding Non-text Content](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content.html)

[How to Meet Non-text Content](http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#non-text-content)

(Level A)

All [non-text content](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-non-text-content) that is presented to the user has a [text alternative](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-text-alternative) that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below.

-   Controls, Input: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a [name](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-name) that describes its purpose. (Refer to [Success Criterion 4.1.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#name-role-value) for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)
-   Time-Based Media: If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to [Guideline 1.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#time-based-media) for additional requirements for media.)
-   Test: If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in [text](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-text), then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
-   Sensory: If non-text content is primarily intended to create a [specific sensory experience,](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-specific-sensory-experience) then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
-   [CAPTCHA](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-captcha): If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.
-   Decoration, Formatting, Invisible: If non-text content is [pure decoration,](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-pure-decoration) is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by [assistive technology](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-assistive-technologies).

## How to test

Use an automated tool to identify alt text for all images. Verify that significant images have appropriate alt text, and that all decorative images are marked as decorative.

## Decisions

### Decorative when described by adjacent text

Where the relevant content of the image is completely described by adjacent text, the image can be marked as decorative with `alt=""`.

Example: A page contains a list of company executives. Each executive has a heading with their name, followed by a small headshot image of the executive. The image can be marked as decorative.
