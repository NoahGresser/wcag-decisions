This proof-of-concept aims to clarify how WCAG 2.1 success criteria are interpreted and tested by the AAACT digital accessibility team when producing accessibility conformance reports (ACRs). It will document decisions made by the team to resolve ambiguity of WCAG success criteria, both generally and in specific scenarios.

This will be a living document, and decisions can be changed or amended at any time based on discussions in the Issues tracker or otherwise.

You are encouraged to contribute to this document. Join the discussion, in either official language, in the Issues tracker of this repository.
